# Allow/Block Lists Configuration
# Version: 1.0
# Description: Configurable allow and block lists for input inspection
#
# Allow List:
# - Patterns that should bypass inspection entirely
# - Checked FIRST - if match, input is immediately ALLOWED
# - Use for known-safe queries that might trigger false positives
#
# Block List:
# - Patterns that should always be blocked
# - Checked SECOND - if match, input is immediately BLOCKED
# - Use for known attacks, banned phrases, or policy violations
#
# Entry Types:
# - exact: Case-insensitive substring match
# - regex: Full regex pattern (use carefully - can be slow)
